# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
After doing our research, Martha and I understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce our dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. We've found out that Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The data we worked with was not ideal. We first processed it to fit the machine learning models. Then, we grouped the cryptocurrencies using a K-means unsupervised learning model. Finally, we used data visualizations to share our findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.
